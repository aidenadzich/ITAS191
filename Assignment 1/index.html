    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <section class="aboutme-container">
        <p class="aboutmetextbox">Lucy was Tilly's closest confidante and her first true friend, forming an unbreakable bond from their earliest memories. They spent countless hours dreaming about the future, laughing until they cried, and supporting each other through lifeâ€™s ups and downs. Their friendship was a beautiful tapestry woven from shared secrets, inside jokes, and countless adventures in their hometown of Hastings.
